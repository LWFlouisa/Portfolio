One of the big issues of being used to monochrome art is website guidelines dont specify whether the mean true black and white such as with a dip or fountain pen. My fear had been then that using charcoal ink and a brush would not be seen as greyscale enough, even though in many cases it provides the best of both worlds between color art and black and white.

In particular when you paint charcoal with a brush, you end up with a greater range of tones that simple black and white tone on its own cant achieve without considerable stippling and cross hatching. Charcoal ink acts like tiny liquid pencils with a more granular amount of shading.

Now depending on how much charcoal you put in vinegar, sometimes it can have a green tint. But this isnt going to show if you scan as greyscale / monochrome.

We need to move dependence on using pens, and learn to embrace fine brush work. As brushwork does just fine in monochrome.

I have started experimenting with reed pen, and like the results.
