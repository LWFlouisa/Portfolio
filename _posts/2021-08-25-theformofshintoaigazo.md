### THE FORM OF SHINTOAIGAZO

I believe that we can extend the potential of Text Comics, beyond what has been on offer from creators in the past. Just because we can put text underneath the panels rather than the panel itself, does not mean that it is a requirement that such text be specifically prosaic, and in fact poetry is often times more efficient at communicating what it is than prose: we have rich language traditions like Haiku, Semonka, Flamenco, and other ethnic poetry traditions to thank for this.

However such traditions have not, as of yet, been introduced into poetry comics, except by route of Comics Poetry proper, and not by route of reviving ancient poetry forms that involve text underneath the panel, rather than within a white box or word balloon. This makes the presentation more visible.

I intend to change this aspect of Comics Poetry, by combining Comics Poetry, Epic Poetry, and Text Comics to create a form unique to the specific aesthetic that I am going for: a generally apocalyptic and darkly romantic narrative, that involves lovers getting the ax.
