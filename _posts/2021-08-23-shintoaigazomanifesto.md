### THE GOALS OF SHINTOAIGAZO

I believe that artists should be free to include as much sex and violence in graphic novels as much as they want to, provided that such sex and violence is done in a tasteful manner. There is a fine line between having unusual fetishes, and splattering the page with excess gore. But good art sometimes comes from dark places, including those an erotic nature.

I believe this because many of my favorite works have included different kinds of gore, but especially decapitations, which is my personal favorite method of execution. My personal favorite arrangement is when someone is beheaded by sword, ax, or guillotine as a form of noble sacrifice for some hopeless cause, generally of a religious or political nature. It is through the erotic nature of such stories, that we can appeal both to literary critics and erotic readers, who like darker work more generally.

There are plenty of ways to show both decapitations and sexual positions tastefully, and it is by no means a requirement that blood cover the page, or that blood itself be painted in an unrealistic or cartoon manner. What I want to change is how gore and erotic content are seen to the academic institution, and to shops outside of the direct market in comics. I call myself a participant in Shintoaigazo.

Shintoaigazo scriptwriters, inkers, and colorists. Let us unite.

### THE LANGUAGE OF SHINTOAIGAZO

I believe that practice the art of Shintoaigazo, one more publish and distribute their work across multiple language channels, and have a body of work whose main languages comprise of Bamboo English, French-Creole, and a fusion constructed language formalized as a fusion of the two languages.

I believe this, because there are multiple suggests that hint at the fact that American has not been an exclusively English language country for a long time, and that to exclusively go against publishing in other languages, goes against the opportunity offered by Licensed Manga. We can do better than simply except content translated to English, because there are plenty of manga-like stories in the languages that we speak here that we can tell.

The reality is, America is a multilingual country, and because of this it is ridiculous to still expect works of graphic narration to be distributed primarily in English, which has not been the only language sense the 19th century. Some people who are of a reactionary leaning, would like to try to keep graphic novels in the past, where people like Steranko represent the best there is to offer in graphic novels.

But the future has arrived, and we can do better than Prose Comics: we can make our manga inspired comics also inspired by Comics Poetry and BD comics from the country of France.

Je suis Shintoaigazo! Unite.

### THE FORM OF SHINTOAIGAZO

I believe that we can extend the potential of Text Comics, beyond what has been on offer from creators in the past. Just because we can put text underneath the panels rather than the panel itself, does not mean that it is a requirement that such text be specifically prosaic, and in fact poetry is often times more efficient at communicating what it is than prose: we have rich language traditions like Haiku, Semonka, Flamenco, and other ethnic poetry traditions to thank for this.

However such traditions have not, as of yet, been introduced into poetry comics, except by route of Comics Poetry proper, and not by route of reviving ancient poetry forms that involve text underneath the panel, rather than within a white box or word balloon. This makes the presentation more visible.

I intend to change this aspect of Comics Poetry, by combining Comics Poetry, Epic Poetry, and Text Comics to create a form unique to the specific aesthetic that I am going for: a generally apocalyptic and darkly romantic narrative, that involves lovers getting the ax.

### DISTRIBUTION OF SHINTOAIGAZO

These Manga inspired oblong books, shall be packaged in discrete packaging, using traditional French and Japanese imagery. The idea is that to a casual person sitting beside you on the train or on the bus, they will not notice that you’re reading an Indie Comic.

When you hand over this book, it is only then that they will see that these books are of a lyrical and prosedy nature. And by that point they will only be invested in the reading experience, where they will read content that is sequential art, but done at a higher production standard than independent comics, which are generally distributed at conventions.

These will be distributed at Farmer’s Markets and other cultural fairs instead, where I intend to offer these with my home roasted coffee. These bags will promote web links and web comic sites designed to spread this reading experience. To me these books should be books everyone reads, not just a small group of geek culture.
