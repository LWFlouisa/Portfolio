### THE LANGUAGE OF SHINTOAIGAZO

I believe that practice the art of Shintoaigazo, one more publish and distribute their work across multiple language channels, and have a body of work whose main languages comprise of Bamboo English, French-Creole, and a fusion constructed language formalized as a fusion of the two languages.

I believe this, because there are multiple suggests that hint at the fact that American has not been an exclusively English language country for a long time, and that to exclusively go against publishing in other languages, goes against the opportunity offered by Licensed Manga. We can do better than simply except content translated to English, because there are plenty of manga-like stories in the languages that we speak here that we can tell.

The reality is, America is a multilingual country, and because of this it is ridiculous to still expect works of graphic narration to be distributed primarily in English, which has not been the only language sense the 19th century. Some people who are of a reactionary leaning, would like to try to keep graphic novels in the past, where people like Steranko represent the best there is to offer in graphic novels.

But the future has arrived, and we can do better than Prose Comics: we can make our manga inspired comics also inspired by Comics Poetry and BD comics from the country of France.

Je suis Shintoaigazo! Unite.
