Besonasige is derived from its ancestor medium Emirotamo. It has two early genres: Nosfe and Erame. Rather than a formal system of genres, like in Manga and Manwha, Besonasige has an unofficial genre system based on the readers gender: these range from comedies for women, to full on tragedies for both genders. Because the society in which Besonasige exists is largely matriarchal, the male oriented genres has been marketed less heavily.

Besonasige is, like Emirotamo, sequential art splits into four frames. Also similarly, text is placed in the gutter-space rather than in captions, similar to early American comic strips. Even the brightest comedies in Besonasige are far darker than any standard comedy in the present day. The word Besonasige itself is derived from the Chinese term “Beisong Shige”, or recited poetry. These are therefore a form of Comics Poetry.

The politics of Besonasige is more of an Alternative Leftist direction, with some bleed over into other idealogies, but largely descended from the anarchist culture that was pervasive in Emirotamo, but the American equivalent to Gekiga with more global ambitions.

Besonasige typically uses a different set of drawing implements and ink, with an appearance that is more similar to Sumi Painting at times, but with Charcoal based ink. Each page typically ranges between one to four panels. This effects also how unofficial genres are depicted, with Besonasige Scifi revolving less of explicit technological based depictions, and more revolving around relationships.

In my next post, I will discuss how to make a Charcoal Ink called Bistre, where you use Reed Pens and Sumi brushes.
