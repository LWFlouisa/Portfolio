I have four Peertube channels:

<a href="https://video.ploud.jp/c/mytalkshow">Red Serpent Inking And Sketching</a><br />
<a href="https://video.ploud.jp/c/roseseropenitoserudos">Red Serpent Essays</a><br />
<a href="https://video.ploud.jp/c/hafestranconlang">Fraponic Conlang</a><br />
<a href="https://video.ploud.jp/c/mypoetry">Red Serpent Poetry</a>

I still have a Youtube, but I don't use it much and hate the culture there. Most of the comic creators ( aside from a few progressives, and not always then increasingly ) don't match my political values in any shape or form.
